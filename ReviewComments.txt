1. Driver can be Initialized at once so to further recreating driver object for better optimization
2. Static wait can be avoided
3. Browser Driver version with the code compatibility should be validated before
4. Method should be mainitained in such a way that those can be reused whenever required
5. Test can be maintatined seperately and page locators should be kept in different package
6. Page factory method could be incorporated to every test case given so enhance the readability and reusability
7. Inheritence should be incorporated to pass the same driver for each of the test case
8. Xpath should be relative for better reliability should avoid absolute ones
9. Hardcoded values can be handled in a seperate util file so to update them accordingly
